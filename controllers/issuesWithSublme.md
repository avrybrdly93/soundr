This is a list of issues that we have with sublme.

The music stops playing as you change pages
won't accept anything but .mp3 and .wav - link to cloudconvert.com?
issues signing up - no input validation
Trouble logging in
If you're not logged in, you can like images, refresh, and keep liking to artificially increase the numbers
Upcoming artists and producers are static - do we want to connect this somehow?  
Youtube video at the bottom seems tacky and takes away from app
search button doesn't connect me to music
signup, login, and comments desperately need styling
It feels empty, not much to do. It is lacking a community.
music bar needs some styling
Sometimes I am logged in but it still shows me the loggedoutnavbar
profile and settings pages are broken
cannot logout
cannot remove songs or comments
cannot reply to comments
cannot like comments or react to them
missing plenty of features
need a favicon
